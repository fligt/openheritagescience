<p>Unless you are a hacker, you probably haven't noticed that open source computing is taking the world of data driven science by storm. Many teams of diverse individuals from all over the world cooperate in successful on-line communities to create amazing software tools. Free open software, for anyone to use, to learn from, and to adapt to ones own needs, equates to empowerment of us all and is a warm invitation to give back to that community for it to foster. I believe that the success of open source software projects is based on tools and infrastructures that enable people to cooperate efficiently. However, equally important are carefully shaped rules of conduct such as open source software licenses.</p>
<p>There is something to be learned here. Just like open source projects, due to its interdisciplinary nature, heritage science projects require teams of divers experts to cooperate creatively. To do so successfully we need computational interpersonal reproducibility: open data, open software, and open publications.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how we can cooperate better in interdisciplinary heritage science projects the open-source-way, then this website is a good way to start. More content will follow soon. Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to contribute.</p>
